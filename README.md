# üß™ Prototype Pollution XSS Demo

This project is an **interactive demonstration** of a client-side **Prototype Pollution** vulnerability, resulting in a bypass of a sanitized HTML allowlist and triggering **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.

## üö® What It Shows

Prototype pollution is a vulnerability unique to JavaScript that allows attackers to tamper with the default object prototype. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security flaws‚Äîsuch as:

- Bypassing \`Object.freeze\`-based allowlists  
- Triggering arbitrary script execution (\`XSS\`)  
- Causing application crashes (DoS)  

This demo walks through:

- The vulnerability basics  
- Code examples of the pollution exploit  
- Real-time, fake chat messages simulating an XSS attack  
- HTML sanitization flaws stemming from polluted prototypes
